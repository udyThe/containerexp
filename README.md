# containerexp: My Containerized Projects

Welcome to **containerexp**! This repository is my personal collection of containerized projects, where I explore Docker to build scalable, efficient, and production-ready applications. Each project demonstrates a different aspect of containerization, ranging from basic image creation to complex multi-container setups.
